        <h2>AM I A FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENT?</h2>
        <div>
            <p>At the University of Michigan, we welcome and encourage students from all different types of backgrounds, including first-generation students. Students are considered first generation college students if neither parent nor guardian has received a 4 year college or university degree. </p>
            <p>This is not to be confused with being a first generation immigrant, which are individuals who are foreign-born and have become naturalized citizens, permanent residents, temporary residents, or migrants. That said, this term is disputed, as some sources consider individuals born to at least one foreign born parent as first generation.</p>
